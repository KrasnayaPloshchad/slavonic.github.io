<div class="row"><div class="col-md-9">

The Slavonic Computing Initiative brings together volunteers who are interested in Church Slavonic 
and dedicated to the philosophy of standards compliance and free and open source software. 
The project depends entirely on the work of volunteers like you.

We do not earn any money in the form of license fees or grants. 
The project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Russian Orthodox Church, or any other ecclesiastic, 
academic or governmental organization.

If you share our passion for Church Slavonic, join us!
