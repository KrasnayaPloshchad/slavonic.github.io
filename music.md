## Znamenny, Demestvenny and related musical notations

This website provides support for Znamenny, Demestvenny and other musical notations. The repertoire of these notations 
has not yet been added to Unicode and adequate support for working with these notations on the computer is not yet 
available.

### Encoding

* [Ecphonetic Notation in Church Slavonic Manuscripts](http://www.ponomar.net/files/ecphonetic.pdf) [PONOMAR GREEN PAPER]

* Slides from Aleksandr Andreev's presentation on Problems of Encoding Znamenny Notation in Unicode 
  given on April 11, 2014, at the Russian Academy of Sciences Library in St. Petersburg (in Russian) 
  [(Download)](http://www.ponomar.net/files/andreev_bch.pdf)

* A. Andreev, Y. Shardt, and N. Simmons. [Proposal to Standardize the Encoding of Palaeoslavic Musical Notations in Unicode](http://www.ponomar.net/files/palaeoslavic.pdf)

### Sandbox

This is the area where developers can play around with computer support of Znamenny notation. Everything in this area 
is UNSUPPORTED and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

* [Znamenny Notation Manual](http://www.ponomar.net/wiki/doku.php?id=znamenny_manual) [Wiki]
