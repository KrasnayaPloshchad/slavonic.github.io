## What is Unicode and why is it important?

Unicode is a universal computing standard for working with texts in all of the world's 
writing systems. When you use Unicode, you ...

* make the text easily available to users around the world on any platform and software environment
* ensure that your text will also be useable in future implementations
* allow your text to be indexable by search engines and other systems
* guarantee compatibility between your project and other projects
